# Discord AI Slash Bot

This repository contains a simple Discord bot that offers AI-based messaging and image generation through two slash commands: `/chat` and `/image`. The bot is optimized for fast response times using `pm2` for process management and `esbuild` for bundling, and it is built with ES Modules.

## Features
- `/chat`: Send a message to an AI and get a response.
- `/image`: Describe what kind of image you want the AI to generate.

## Requirements
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (or yarn)
- Discord Developer account

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onecvi/discord-ai-bot.git
   cd discord-ai-bot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory and adding your Discord bot token:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
   ```
4. Start the bot using `pm2` for process management:
   ```bash
   pm2 start index.mjs --name discord-ai-bot
   ```
   Or start it directly:
   ```bash
   node index.mjs
   ```
5. Use the `/chat` and `/image` commands in your Discord server to interact with the AI.
