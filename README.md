# Discord AI

This repository contains a simple Discord bot that offers AI-based messaging and image generation through two slash commands: `/chat` and `/image`. The bot is optimized for fast response times using `pm2` for process management and `esbuild` for bundling, and it is built with ES Modules.

## Features

- `/chat`: Send a message to an AI and get a response.
- `/image`: Describe what kind of image you want the AI to generate.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (or yarn)
- Discord Developer account

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/discord-ai-slash-bot.git
   cd discord-ai-slash-bot
